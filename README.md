## Project Overview
This project analyzes the StackOverflow Developer Survey data to uncover insights about developer compensation patterns using machine learning and statistical hypothesis testing.

## Libraries Used
- **pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis
- **numpy**: Numerical computing
- **matplotlib & seaborn**: Data visualization
- **scikit-learn**: Machine learning models and evaluation
- **scipy**: Statistical testing
- **warnings**: Error handling

## Motivation
Understanding developer salary patterns is crucial for:
- Career planning and optimization
- Skill investment decisions
- Geographic arbitrage opportunities
- Specialization vs. generalization strategies

This analysis provides data-driven insights to help developers make informed career decisions.

## Files in Repository
- `BlogPost_Final.docx`: Complete analysis notebook with methodology and results
- `survey_results_public.csv`: StackOverflow survey data (not included - download from StackOverflow)
- `survey_results_schema.csv`: Data schema documentation
- `README.md`: Project documentation

## Key Questions Analyzed
1. **Feature Importance**: What factors most strongly predict developer salaries?
2. **Hidden Patterns**: What unexpected insights exist in compensation data?
3. **Model Accuracy**: How reliable are our salary predictions?
4. **Career Scenarios**: What strategic career moves provide the best ROI?

## Summary of Results
- **Remote Work Premium**: Remote developers earn $21,700 more on average than in-person workers
- **Specialization Benefits**: Management roles command 91% salary premium, Data Science 37% premium
- **Education-Experience Interaction**: Education impact decreases with experience (0.292 ‚Üí 0.091 correlation)
- **Model Performance**: Random Forest achieves R¬≤ = 0.638 with ¬±$8,086 prediction accuracy
- **Geographic Impact**: High-cost areas provide significant salary arbitrage opportunities

## Business Impact
- **Career Planning**: Clear guidance on remote work and specialization strategies
- **Skill Investment**: Quantified ROI for different career paths
- **Salary Negotiation**: Data-driven benchmarks for compensation discussions
